Data Flow Architecture (Importance: 95/100)

1. Video Frame Extraction Pipeline
- Input: Raw video file
- Frame sampling with adaptive FPS calculation
- Deduplication using MD5 + pHash similarity
- Output: ≤96 representative frames distributed across timeline

2. Concurrent Analysis Flow (Importance: 90/100)
```
Video Frames → Task Distribution Layer
    ↓
4 Parallel Analysis Streams:
    - Role Detection
    - Face Visibility
    - Scene Classification
    - Pose Analysis
    ↓
Batch Aggregation Layer
```

3. Label Processing Pipeline (Importance: 85/100)
- Frequency-based label selection per category
- Multi-stage validation and normalization
- Context enrichment with metadata
- Aggregation into naming context object

4. Name Generation Flow (Importance: 90/100)
```
Analysis Results → Style Template Selection
    ↓
Context-Aware Name Generation
    ↓
Multi-Factor Name Scoring
    ↓
Sanitized Output Names
```

Key Integration Points:

1. Frame Batch Assignment
src/vrenamer/webui/services/pipeline.py
- Frame distribution with 70% utilization target
- Time-based sampling across video timeline
- Dynamic batch size optimization

2. Analysis Results Aggregation
src/vrenamer/services/analysis.py
- Two-layer concurrent execution model
- Cross-task label correlation
- Frequency-based consensus building

3. Name Generation Pipeline
src/vrenamer/naming/generator.py
- Style-based template application
- Multi-factor name scoring
- Adult content-aware sanitization
