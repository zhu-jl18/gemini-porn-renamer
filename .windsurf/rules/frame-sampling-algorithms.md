# frame-sampling-algorithms

Importance Score: 85/100

Core Frame Sampling Components:

1. Adaptive Frame Sampling System
- Dynamic sampling rate calculation based on video duration
- Target frame count â‰¤ 96 frames per video
- Temporal coverage optimization across video timeline
- Frame distribution weighting favoring key scenes

2. Deduplication Pipeline
- Two-stage frame similarity detection:
  * MD5 hash comparison for exact matches
  * perceptual hash (pHash) for near-duplicate detection
- Similarity threshold adjustments for content type
- Frame retention prioritization based on scene importance

3. Frame Distribution Algorithm
`src/vrenamer/services/video.py`:
- Uniform temporal coverage calculation
- Dynamic FPS adjustment based on video length
- Frame batch assignment with 70% utilization target
- Intelligent frame shuffling for diverse sampling

4. Temporal Coverage Logic
`src/vrenamer/webui/services/pipeline.py`:
- Time-based frame selection strategy
- Video timeline segmentation
- Representative frame selection per segment
- Frame quality assessment for segment coverage

Key Implementation Features:
- Batch-oriented frame processing
- Scene change detection integration
- Frame quality metrics
- Content-aware sampling rates

Frame Selection Criteria:
1. Temporal distribution
2. Visual uniqueness
3. Scene representation
4. Frame quality metrics
5. Content relevance
