description: Documents the two-layer concurrent video frame analysis system for processing and analyzing video content

# concurrent-analysis-system

The concurrent analysis system implements a two-layer approach for parallel video frame processing:

### Layer 1: Task-Level Concurrency (Importance: 95/100)
`src/vrenamer/services/analysis.py`
- Distributes independent analysis tasks across 4 parallel executors:
  - Role detection analysis
  - Face visibility analysis 
  - Scene type classification
  - Pose detection
- Each task operates independently with its own resource allocation
- Task results are aggregated through frequency-based label selection

### Layer 2: Frame Batch Processing (Importance: 90/100)
`src/vrenamer/services/analysis.py`
- Each analysis task processes multiple frame batches concurrently
- Maximum of 16 concurrent API calls per task
- Implements batch distribution logic with optimal frame coverage
- Handles dynamic batch size adjustment based on task requirements

### Batch Assignment Algorithm (Importance: 85/100)
`src/vrenamer/webui/services/pipeline.py`
- Distributes frame batches targeting 70% resource utilization
- Implements time-based frame selection for video timeline coverage
- Frame shuffling mechanism ensures diverse sampling within batches
- Batch size adapts to task-specific analysis requirements

### Task Orchestration (Importance: 80/100)
- Manages concurrent task execution across both layers
- Handles task dependencies and result aggregation
- Implements failover mechanisms for failed analysis tasks
- Provides real-time task progress monitoring

Core System Flow:
1. Video frame extraction and batch creation
2. Distribution of batches across Layer 1 tasks
3. Concurrent processing within each task (Layer 2)
4. Result aggregation and label selection
5. Final analysis compilation
